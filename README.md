Book Managemen

**1. Back-End Development:**
   - Use **Spring Boot** for creating RESTful services.
   - Implement CRUD operations for books:
     - **POST** `/books` to create a new book.
     - **GET** `/books/{id}` to retrieve a book by ID.
     - **PUT** `/books/{id}` to update a book's details.
     - **DELETE** `/books/{id}` to delete a book.
   - Use **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the database.
   - Define a **Book** entity with fields for title, author, publication year, and ISBN.

**2. Database Implementation:**
   - Choose a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
   - Design the schema to reflect the Book entity.

**3. Front-End Development:**
   - For the web UI, you can use frameworks like **React** or **Angular**.
   - For the mobile UI, use **Kotlin** for Android and **Swift** for iOS.
   - The UI should allow users to perform all CRUD operations.

**4. Microservices Architecture:**
   - Design the system with microservices in mind, possibly separating book management and user interface into different services.

**5. Containerization:**
   - Use **Docker** to containerize your application.
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for the back-end and front-end.

**6. Cloud Deployment:**
   - Deploy your containers to a cloud platform like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform**.

**7. Version Control:**
   - Use **Git** for version control.
   - Commit small, incremental changes to a public repository.

**8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment process.

**9. Documentation:**
   - Document the deployment process and provide a `README.md` with build, run, and test instructions.

**10. Testing:**
   - Apply TDD principles and write unit tests for both back-end and front-end.

**Assumptions:**
   - Users are authenticated and authorized to perform operations.
   - The system is designed for scalability and high availability.
